# Quadractic function cryptography
A very basic concept of cryptography I made to further sharpen my knowledge in the quadratic function and cryptography in general.
The script works by assigning ASCII values to an user's text, then applying a quadratic equation - of which coefficients are user's choice - to the ASCII values. The text can then be decrypted, by giving the encrypted text and the coefficients (keys.)
